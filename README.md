# Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 Arch Linux Guide and Scripts
This guide takes inspiration from https://github.com/joshuagrisham/galaxy-book2-pro-linux
the main difference is that many of the fixes needed further work arounds or just didn't work because of the difference in firmware in addition to this being the 360 model which seems to differ greatly from regular model. Because of this reason I am creating my own guide for the fixes that I took in order to make Arch Linux run on this laptop.
